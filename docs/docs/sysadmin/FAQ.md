# Frequently Asked Questions


## **Q:** Why the name shipper?

We needed a way to "ship" build artifacts, so "shipper" "ships" these build artifacts.

Yeah, the backstory isn't very interesting. At least the name is cute!

## **Q:** Where are the builds stored?

shipper saves uploaded artifacts to a Docker volume. To extract these files, you may need root access. Go to the Docker directory for volumes and find the volume for media files.
