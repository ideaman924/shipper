# Overview

## What is shipper?

shipper is an artifact release manager for custom ROM teams looking for easy build artifact distribution, starting from maintainers right up to the users. Maintainers can easily upload builds that users can then download for their respective devices. Access control makes sure that maintainers can only upload for their devices, and useful features in shipper help users get builds more easily and allows for other services to access the downloads server, like OTA (over-the-air) update applications embedded in custom ROMs.
