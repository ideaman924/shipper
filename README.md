Artifact release manager with  access control, API support and user presentation

## Installation

You can deploy shipper to a PaaS (platform-as-a-service) like Heroku, PythonAnywhere, etc. or your own server, but a barebones install requires you to bring your own infrastructure dependencies, like PostgreSQL for the database and RabbitMQ for queuing tasks, etc.

If you would rather not deal with that, we have a Docker-based installation procedure available at [shipperstack/shipper-docker](https://github.com/shipperstack/shipper-docker). Learn more by following the link!
